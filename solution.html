          <h>Instruction's</h>
          <p>
            1. Set up the Development Environment a.Download Android Studio.
            b.Select Android 23 (Marshmallow) while configuring the environment
            (The M300 works with Android SDK v23). c.Download M300 SDK as per
            the instruction given on the Vuzix portal.
          </p>

          <p>
            2. Set up Vuzix M-300 a.Set up Vuzix M300 Augmented Reality Glasses
            as per the M300 user manual. b.Set up a stable Wi-Fi connection as
            specified in the M300 user manual. c.Run available demos
            (video_hw_encoding, camera_flash, camera_focus, barcode_v3).
            d.Validate that the demos work.
          </p>

          <p>
            3. Setup Microsoft Vision API's a.Create an Azure account. b.Create
            Services for Computer Vision API. c.Generate Computer Vision keys to
            be used in the main program. These keys contain the access to
            Azure's respective APIs
          </p>

          <p>
            4. Test Microsoft Vision API's a.Use Azure Cognitive and AI API's to
            perform video analytics. b.The Azure API's will determine various
            things like people detection, emotion analysis, object detection,
            optical character reading. The testing tool is <br />
            provided by Microsoft on the Microsoft AI portal.
          </p>

          <p>
            5. Coding a.Create a new Android project with a form and two buttons
            – one for a single image click, and another for continuous image
            clicks. Take appropriate <br />
            functions from Vuzix Sample Projects that helps in image capture.
            b.Converting the captured imagebytes to a byte array and call the
            appropriate vision API. c.When the picture is clicked, take the byte
            stream and send an HTTP request to the Vision API. d.Take the
            response, and parse it to get the output of the API that describes
            what the camera is "Seeing“. e.Pass the response to the Text to
            Speech Engine, which routes this to have the speaker articulate what
            it is seeing in audio format. f.Create another button, doing the
            above repeatedly until prompted to stop.
          </p>

          <p>
            6. Testing a.Transfer the application to the Vuzix M300 device.
            b.Turn the M300’s wi-fi on, connect to a stable wi-fi source. A
            smartphone is used her as the testing is done indoors and outdoors.
            c.Run it to see about different objects and note the accuracy of the
            device and API. Take some conditions in low light as well. a.20
            objects at about 10 feet, good light (daylight or a well lit room).
            b.20 objects at about 20 feet, good light (daylight or a well lit
            room). c.20 objects at about 30 feet, good light (daylight or a well
            lit room). d.20 objects at about 10 feet, insufficient light
            (dawn/dusk or a low lit room). e.20 objects at about 20 feet,
            insufficient light (dawn/dusk or a low lit room). f.20 objects at
            about 30 feet, insufficient light (dawn/dusk or a low lit room).
            g.Run the continuous viewing for the good and low light conditions
          </p>

          <p>
            7. Result a. Document the results, take photographs of the
            object/scene which the Vuzix M300 is pointed to. Categorize the
            results as accurate, semi accurate, or <br />
            inaccurate
